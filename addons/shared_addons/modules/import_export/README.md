#PyroCMS Import/Export

## Description

A PyroCMS module that lets you export from one instance of PyroCMS into another. The module, as of version 1.1.0, also lets you import your WordPress site into PyroCMS.

Step 1: Extract contents of this zip (or clone) to a new folder:

	addons/<site-ref>/modules/import_export
